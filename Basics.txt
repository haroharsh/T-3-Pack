The basic properties of a graph include:

1. Vertices (nodes): 
The points where edges meet in a graph are known as vertices or nodes. A vertex can represent a physical object, concept, or abstract entity.


2. Edges:
The connections between vertices are known as edges. They can be undirected (bidirectional) or directed (unidirectional).


3. Weight: 
A weight can be assigned to an edge, representing the cost or distance between two vertices. A weighted graph is a graph where the edges have weights.


4. Degree: 
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it.
In a directed graph, the in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges that point to it, and the out-degree is the number of edges that start from it.


5. Path: A path is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. A simple path does not contain any repeated vertices or edges.


6. Cycle: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A simple cycle does not contain any repeated vertices or edges.


7. Connectedness: A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between any two vertices. A disconnected graph is a graph that is not connected.


8. Planarity: A graph is said to be planar if it can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing each other.


9. Bipartiteness: A graph is said to be bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices in the same set are connected by an edge.
