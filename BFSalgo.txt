*** BFS Algorithm ***


BFS(Graph, root):
    for each node in Graph:
        node.color = "white"
        node.distance = âˆž
        node.parent = null

    root.color = "gray"
    root.distance = 0
    root.parent = null

    create an empty queue Q
    enqueue(Q, root)

    while Q is not empty:
        current = dequeue(Q)

        for each neighbor in Graph[current]:
            if neighbor.color == "white":
                neighbor.color = "gray"
                neighbor.distance = current.distance + 1
                neighbor.parent = current
                enqueue(Q, neighbor)

        current.color = "black"
