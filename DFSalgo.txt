*** DFS Algorithm ***


DFS(Graph, root):
    for each node in Graph:
        node.color = "white"
        node.parent = null
        node.distance = âˆž

    root.distance = 0
    DFS-Visit(Graph, root)

DFS-Visit(Graph, node):
    node.color = "gray"

    for each neighbor in Graph[node]:
        if neighbor.color == "white":
            neighbor.parent = node
            neighbor.distance = node.distance + 1
            DFS-Visit(Graph, neighbor)

    node.color = "black"
